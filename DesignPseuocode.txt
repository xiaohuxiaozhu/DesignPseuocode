2. How much water runs off the roof

I: The roof dimensions of footprint 50'x20' roof is 600"x240"

P: multiply the roof dimensions inches
   count number of inches of rainfall
   Total of inches multiply 231
   
Out: multiply roof dimension in inches x Total of rainfall / 231

//How to calculate gallons of rainwater that can be collected from a roof
In order to figure out the size of the tank you will need to store the rainfall collected in your rainwater
harvesting system, it is important to know how large the roof is. Most rain events are 1 inch or less.
Method
1.Measure the length and the width of the roof but check where the downspouts are to find what part
of the roof drains to each downspout when there is more than one downspout. For example, if the roof
is pitched in 2 directions and you are only able to use the downspout on one side then just measure the
part of the roof that drains to the downspout you will use.
2.Every square foot of roof space collects .6 gallons of water in a 1 inch rainfall.
3.To account for losses and inefficiency, you can expect to collect about 75% of the actual rainfall so
your calculation should be multiplied by .75
Formula
Length of roof ____________ feet
X width of roof ___________ feet
X.6gallons per square ft
X .75
X __________________inches of rainfall
= _______________________gallons of rainfall collected//


   public class totalwaterrun {

   public static void main(String twr[])
   
   {
   
//calculate roof dimensions "z" of footprint 50'x20' roof is 600"x240"//

    int x=600;
	int y=240;
	int z=x*y;
	
	
	
//count number of inches of rainfall "t"//

 do
 {
     t[count] = number;
	 
	 if (t[count] =0)
	 
	 { 
	 
	    count++;
		
		}
		}
		
		for {sum=sum+t;
		}
		
 

//multiply roof dimension in inches x Total of rainfall / 231//

    int m=z*t/231;

	 System.out.println("Roof Demensions:" +z);
	 System.out.println("Total inches of rainfall:" +t);
	 System.out.println("How much water runs off the roof:" +m);
